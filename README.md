# RPF toolbox

A toolbox for conducting relative psychometric function analysis.

To get started using the toolbox, see the following files:

- The function `RPF_guide` provides documentation and guidance for how to use the RPF toolbox
- The scripts `RPF_example_simple` and `RPF_example_flexible` provide examples of data analysis using the toolbox

Please note that the RPF toolbox requires the following toolboxes:

- [Palamedes toolbox](https://www.palamedestoolbox.org/)
- [Optimization toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html)
- [meta-d' toolbox](https://www.columbia.edu/~bsm2105/type2sdt/) (included in the `metad` folder of this repository)
