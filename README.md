# RPF toolbox

A toolbox for conducting relative psychometric function analysis.

Documentation is under development. To get started using the toolbox, see the following files:

- `RPF` for a brief general overview
- `RPF_info` for information on how to configure analysis using the info struct
- `RPF_example_simple` and `RPF_example_flexible` for demo scripts containing analyses for an example data set

Please note that the RPF toolbox requires the following toolboxes:

- Palamedes toolbox (https://www.palamedestoolbox.org/)
- Optimization toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html)
- meta-d' toolbox (included in the `metad` folder of this repository; see also https://www.columbia.edu/~bsm2105/type2sdt/)
